# About Game
<ul>
  <li>The Flappy Bird Game In Python is an arcade game in which the player controls FABY, a continuously right-moving bird</li>
  <li>FABY must be guided between pairs of pipes with equal-sized gaps at random heights.</li>
  <li>When the player taps the touchscreen, FABY drops automatically and only ascends when the player taps again.</li>
  <li>The player receives one point for each successful pass through two pipes.</li>
  <li>The game ends when FABY collides with a pipe or the ground</li>
  <li>Score is then displayed on the screen</li>
</ul>

# Stepwise Implementation
<ul>
  <li>Import libraries</li>
  <li>After declaring game variables and importing libraries we have to initialize the Pygame.</li>
  <li>Initialize the position of the bird and starting the game loop.</li>
  <li>Create a function that generates a new pipe of random height.</li>
  <li>Now we create a GameOver() function which represents whether the bird has hit the pipes or ground</li>
  <li>Create the main() function</li>
</ul>
