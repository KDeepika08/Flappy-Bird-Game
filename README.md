#About Game
<ul>
  <li>The Flappy Bird Game In Python is an arcade game in which the player controls FABY, a continuously right-moving bird</li>
  <li>FABY must be guided between pairs of pipes with equal-sized gaps at random heights.</li>
  <li>When the player taps the touchscreen, FABY drops automatically and only ascends when the player taps again.</li>
  <li>The player receives one point for each successful pass through two pipes.</li>
  <li>The game ends when FABY collides with a pipe or the ground</li>
  <li>Score is then displayed on the screen</li>
</ul>
